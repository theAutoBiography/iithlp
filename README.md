# IITHLP

A comprehensive transliteration scheme for Indian languages with a strict one-to-one character mapping.

## Overview

IITHLP is a Python package that provides a comprehensive transliteration scheme for 9 major Indian scripts covering 21 scheduled Indian languages. It ensures a strict one-to-one mapping between each Indic character and a single Roman character (with diacritics as needed), ensuring perfect reversibility while maintaining phonetic similarity.

## Supported Scripts and Languages

IITHLP v0.2.1 provides comprehensive transliteration support for 11 Indian scripts covering 19 of the 22 scheduled Indian languages:

| Script | Languages |
|--------|-----------|
| Devanagari | Hindi, Sanskrit, Marathi, Nepali, Konkani, Bodo, Maithili, Dogri |
| Bengali | Bengali, Assamese |
| Tamil | Tamil |
| Malayalam | Malayalam |
| Telugu | Telugu |
| Kannada | Kannada |
| Gurmukhi | Punjabi |
| Gujarati | Gujarati |
| Odia | Odia |
| Ol Chiki | Santali |
| Meitei Mayek | Manipuri |

### Languages Not Covered

The following scheduled Indian languages are not currently supported:

- Urdu (uses Perso-Arabic script)
- Kashmiri (primarily uses Perso-Arabic script)
- Sindhi (uses Perso-Arabic script)

All supported scripts feature a strict one-to-one mapping between each Indic character and a single Roman character (with diacritics as needed), ensuring perfect reversibility while maintaining phonetic similarity.

## Features

- **Strict one-to-one mapping**: Each Indic character maps to exactly one Roman character (with diacritics as needed)
- **Perfect reversibility**: Guaranteed round-trip conversion without information loss
- **Script detection**: Automatically detects the script of input text
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Supports all characters, including vowels, consonants, matras, and special symbols
- **Easy to use**: Simple API for both script-to-Roman and Roman-to-script conversion

## Installation

```bash
# You can install directly from the provided Python file
pip install iithlp
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from iithlp import to_roman, to_script

# Transliterate from an Indian script to Roman
roman_text = to_roman("नमस्ते दुनिया")  # Devanagari
print(roman_text)  # "nmsⁿté dúníyā́"

# Transliterate from Roman to an Indian script
devanagari_text = to_script("nmsⁿté dúníyā́", script="devanagari")
print(devanagari_text)  # "नमस्ते दुनिया"
```

### Script Detection

```python
from iithlp import IITHLP

# Create a transliterator instance
transliterator = IITHLP()

# Detect script of text
text = "ಕನ್ನಡ"
detected_script = transliterator.detect_script(text)
print(detected_script)  # 'kannada'
```

### Getting Supported Scripts

```python
from iithlp import get_supported_scripts

# Get all supported scripts
scripts = get_supported_scripts()
print(scripts)  # ['devanagari', 'bengali', 'tamil', ...]
```

## Mapping Scheme

The mapping scheme follows these principles:

1. **Phonetic similarity**: Similar sounds have similar representations
2. **Diacritics for disambiguation**: Diacritics are used to distinguish between similar sounds
3. **Consistency**: Similar patterns across scripts are represented consistently
4. **Reversibility**: The scheme ensures perfect round-trip conversion
